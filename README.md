# Smoke-Detection-System
Smoke Detection System is an IoT-based safety project designed using the ESP32 microcontroller and an MQ-2 gas/smoke sensor to monitor air quality and detect the presence of harmful smoke or gases. When the concentration of smoke exceeds a defined threshold, the system activates visual (LED) and audible (buzzer) alarms to alert users immediately. The MQ-2 sensor continuously monitors the air, and the ESP32 processes the data in real-time. This system can be extended to send alerts to a cloud platform or mobile application via Wi-Fi, making it ideal for smart homes, labs, and industrial safety setups. Its simplicity, affordability, and expandability make it an effective early-warning tool for fire or gas leak incidents.
